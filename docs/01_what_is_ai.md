# What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. The term was coined by John McCarthy in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, which is widely considered the birth of AI as a field.

## Narrow AI vs. General AI

**Narrow AI** (also called Weak AI) is designed to perform a specific task — like recognizing faces, playing chess, or recommending movies. All current AI systems fall into this category. They excel at their specific domain but cannot generalize beyond it.

**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** refers to a hypothetical machine that can perform any intellectual task that a human can. No AGI exists today. It remains an open research problem.

**Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)** would surpass human intelligence in all domains. This is purely theoretical and subject to much debate.

## Key Branches of AI

- **Machine Learning (ML):** Systems that learn from data without being explicitly programmed for each task.
- **Deep Learning:** A subset of ML using neural networks with many layers to learn hierarchical representations.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Enables machines to understand, generate, and manipulate human language.
- **Computer Vision:** Enables machines to interpret visual information from images and video.
- **Robotics:** Combines AI with physical machines to perform tasks in the real world.
- **Expert Systems:** Rule-based systems that encode human expertise to solve domain-specific problems.

## Why AI Matters

AI is transforming virtually every industry. In healthcare, AI assists in diagnosing diseases from medical images. In finance, it detects fraud in real-time. In transportation, it powers self-driving vehicles. In education, it personalizes learning experiences.

The economic impact is enormous. According to various estimates, AI could contribute trillions of dollars to the global economy over the next decade.

## Challenges in AI

Despite rapid progress, AI faces significant challenges:
- **Data dependency:** Most ML models need large, high-quality labeled datasets.
- **Bias:** If training data contains biases, the model will inherit them.
- **Interpretability:** Deep learning models are often "black boxes" — hard to explain.
- **Energy costs:** Training large models requires enormous computational resources.
- **Alignment:** Ensuring AI systems act in alignment with human values and intentions.

## A Brief History
